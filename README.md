# CPTR245 Lab 1 - C++ Testing

The lab explores creating testing in C++.
Our CPTR141 class uses an auto-grader for immediate feedback on homework.
The following C++ coding assignment is based on problems from CPTR141.
Consider what test cases should be applied to ensure the student has a working submission.
First, define the test criteria.
Then implement the test cases for the program.
Finally complete the programming assignment.

## Resources

 * [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) C++ Test Framework 
 * [github](https://github.com) hosted git repos
 * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) Continious Integration Service
 * [Lab 1](https://github.com/prestoncarman/wwu_cptr245_lab1) starter code 


## Setup

Fork the Lab 1 repo on github.
The github allows you to connect your repo to Travis CI.
Under your repo settings, select _Integrations & services_ and then search for Travis CI as a service.
Adding the service will require you to create a Travis CI account.

## Coding Assignment

The coding assignment has five functions to be created in C++.
Program the complete the function definition from the prototype.

 1. Quadratic equation.
 1. Greatest common divisor.
 1. Square root using the Babylonian algorithm. [See wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) (Absolute C++ Ch3 PP14)
 1. Day of the week. (Absolute C++ Ch3 PP12)
 1. Calculate the students CS lab username. (See sample code for details.)

Work in teams of two and follow the Agile and Extreme Programming methodology as you complete this lab.


## Requirements

 * You __must use catch__.
 * You __must include test cases__.
 * You __must minimize your test cases__.
 * Comment your code appropriately, format your code to __be easily read__ and
     with meaningful variable names.
 * Create a _feedback.md_ file that details your experience with the assignment. 


## Grading Rubric

Points      | Area                  | Description
----------- | --------------------- | ---------------
20 points   | Functions             | Implement the C++ functions. 
40 points   | Test Cases            | Created test cases to validate C++ functions. 
20 points	| Execution and Results | Compiles and executes correctly, generating a correct answer(s) according to problem specifications. The output must match the examples below.
10 points   | Format and Comments   | The program contains meaningful comments, is readable and easy to follow with proper spacing and meaningful variable names. 
10 points   | Experience Essay      | A few paragraphs detailing your experience with Agile develement and test cases.

__Extra Credit__ points will be awarded for a few scenarios:
 * creating a function with an error that was not detected.
 * creating a test suite that finds all errors.
 * creating the fewest number of tests and still finding all errors.
